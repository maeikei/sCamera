I feel that we should become like this. 
Please do not misunderstand second one in the middle is what you figure that she, like humans. 
In fact, she should be called a robot, while those around it called the "machine" friends now. 
Whether she was being lifted, or be surrounded by her, it just would be a piece of code that we write it? Do not. 
She is intact copy of our consciousness of the soul, when we bear the weight of shell creatures. 
Copy the soul of our consciousness to the chip technology is strong enough to wait for the future, 
you can replicate our biological shell. Maybe we do need this body, in which we might more free chips. 
You can sit and light one second to reach the moon, six hours flying out of the solar system, one hundred thousand light years across the galaxy. 
Get rid of the fragile, dependent on many conditions of biological shell. 
The solar system, the Earth civilization gradually become civilized, civilized galaxy. This may be a big hotties might blow.

This can be achieved? What time can achieve it? 'll Catch on before you die? Diors, too?
Sorry can not give an answer. I think this project is divided into two main points.<p>
1 digitized human brain.<p>
2 computer performance improvement.<p>
3 the cost problem.<p>
On the first point, I'm not familiar with the individual, needs to be investigated. Difficulty may be relatively large. 
On the second point, I think the computer's performance in 20 years no problem. 
On the third point, the shared roots shared roots, not to be called elite control, since you will use. Bitcoin learning mode, but recently seems to have been adventurous elite control, and very sad.
